# Duke-CSA-iOS
Duke CSA is an app that teaches you how to get an A for every class.
No it's not. I'm lying.
Ok seriously.

Duke CSA is the very first app specifically designed and developed for Duke University Chinese Student Association.

We use Swift as the main language for development, and Parse.com as database.

Users need to login with their facebook account, and NetIDs are required.

Through the app, CSA execs post newest events and bulletins, and members will get notifications for every update.

A section named 'Rendezvous' allows users to post social request for dinners, movies, sports, and etc.

Several interesting functionalities such as 'Crush' and 'Spotlight' are also integrated in the app, to make life a bit more colorful.

The app is in its youth and of great potential, and I will keep maintaining and updating it.
