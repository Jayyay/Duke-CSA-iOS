# Duke-CSA-iOS
Duke CSA is an app that teaches you how to get an A for every class.
No it's not. I'm lying.
Ok seriously.

Duke CSA is the very first app specifically designed and developed for Duke University Chinese Student Association.

We use Swift as the main language for development, and Parse.com as BaaS in the beginning.

However Parse.com was open-sourced and shutdown a while ago, and we migrated to Back4App.

Users need to login with their Facebook account, and NetIDs are required.

Through the app, CSA execs post newest events and bulletins, and members will get notifications for every update.

A section named 'Rendezvous' allows users to post social request for dinners, movies, sports, and etc.

Several interesting functionalities such as 'Crush' and 'Spotlight' are also integrated in the app, to make life a bit more colorful.

We are currently updating the Swift Syntax to 4 and hopefully we don't break anything.
