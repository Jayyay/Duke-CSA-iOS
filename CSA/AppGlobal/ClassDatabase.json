The hardest thing about this class is deciphering her instructions for assignments.Workload: The amount of homework is consistent each week: 1 assignment, 1 APT set (small coding exercises), and 1 lab (which is usually finished during lab section). Assignments, APTs, and labs do get harder as the semester progresses, and I probably spent around 5-6 hours on the aforementioned homework near the end of the course.Commentss: Professor Rodger is not the best lecturer, but her class is very organized and the course website she has is a godsend. The textbook she uses is also very good for learning Python and some computer basics. Overall, this class was pretty fun, and I would recommend doing all the extra credit assignments because they provide you a really nice grade buffer in the end. However, this course does not do a good job of preparing you for COMPSCI 201.",

Go to class if you can, otherwise watch the lectures when you can. Don't get too far behind-- it's really hard to catch up. Do well on the assignments since it is the largest portion of your grade.

Project 3 is also time consuming especially if you don't plan for it because it's literally right before finals come around. The projects are tough so make sure you get a good group to work with; you'll most likely be in these groups all semester unless there's a huge issue. Landon isn't the most interesting guy, but he's very helpful and understanding. The midterm and finals are incredibly easy and the curve is great. I would say you probably don't need to study much if you've been active about working on the projects. The exams are all simple extentions of the projects, so if you've been doing the projects, you'll be fine. You get a cheat sheet for both the exam and the final.

There is also a group final project that you must complete. You can put as much or as little effort into this (and this could also be helpful in building your side project portfolio), but don't save it until the last minute because it is definitely time consuming. Pick a good group. His lectures are basically a repeat of the slides he uploads online. In my opinion, the textbook will definitely be your best friend. There is one midterm and a final exam. Both are open notes, open book, etc. You can use your laptop (no Google-ing but you can use the course website to look at notes) and if you have the textbook, you can easily CTRL-F for the topics, etc. during the exams. Do the extra credit for each homework assignment because they aren't terribly difficult and it's definitely your best grade booster. You learn a lot about the back-end, but you need to be very passionate about databases not to be bored every lecture. Lastly, the grading is very fair and the professor is really nice & understanding. He's a little monotone in lecture, but he's very willing to help students and very passionate about the subject. The UTAs are sometimes very aloof/not consistent with office hours so I really suggest going to Jun's office hours if you need any clarification/help.",

Not a hard class; my class’s average final grade ended up being an A-, which is typical of the course.Workload: There is reading assigned each week. These readings can be helpful on the essay section of your midterm. Pop quizzes are normally three easy questions based off of the readings, and Professor Starn makes huge hints about when quizzes are, so most of the class just did the readings whenever he made hints.",

I personally find the subject material very interesting, and I actually did all of the readings the entire semester (about 3 hours per week), but most of the rest of the class did not, which had a negative impact on my experience in class discussions. The class discussions - and in fact, the class itself - also wasn't structured enough for my liking, and the focus was mostly on the two ways of interpreting the city (experiential, and through theories of political economy), but I felt like none of the other students (or myself, for that matter) had enough of a grasp on the theoretical aspect to make our dialogues meaningful. But if you're a CulAnth major and you're interested in the topic - well, go for it. I'm sure you have a better idea of what to expect",

The project this year is to build a calendar, which isn't very interesting. Groups are free to choose what languages, tools, and technologies they use to build the calendar. Code must be designed to be as extensible and flexible as possible because new requirements may be drastically different from previous requirements. About half of the class periods are \"discussion days\", during which we discuss various aspects of good design and coding practice. The other half are \"work days\", which means no official class meeting for that period and groups are free to meet on their own. Overall I feel it's worth taking if you are considering a career in software simply because it gives you experience working on a relatively large project from scratch and you get to be involved in all aspects of the project (database, frontend, backend) and also learn different technologies.",

Fullenkamp’s tests are tricky, and the top scores normally fall in the 50-70% range. Workload: Not that much work – one problem set a week, though the problem set is very difficult and sometimes rather lengthy. Fullenkamp only checks for completion, though, so no worries about doing everything completely accurately.\n  Commentss: While the class does not require a lot of work on the surface, it is very hard to do well, given how large the class size is and how tough Fullenkamp likes to make the course. Regardless, it is still possible to get an A/B+ (he curves somewhat generously), but only if you put in a lot of effort outside of class to really understand the concepts. I would also encourage meeting with him one-on-one – he’s a lot less intimidating and a lot more helpful than he is in lecture.",

There is a lot of work in this class, especially because it is in a backwards classroom format. Do not get behind; it's near impossible to catch up. Classes may or may not be useful to you, but I highly suggest it. Watch his video lectures because he covers a lot of material not in the textbook (pretty useless, in my honest opinion). He tests over application so don't rely on rote memorization. He does not grade for accuracy on problem sets, but do them to the best of your ability! They are the most useful resource when studying for exams. The curve is pretty generous, and he offers grade insurance up to a C if you do all the problem sets and \"try\" on exams. This is a weedout class, so be prepared. That being said, I think this is probably the class I learned the most in during my first year at Duke.",

It's somewhat entertaining and at least he tries. He's very brilliant and his TAs are phenomenal. Go to office hours if you're confused. Everything stacks on top of each other so the earlier you get help, the better. There's a problem set due every other week (7 in total), a midterm, and a final exam. He grades very efficiently so you generally get everything back in a VERY reasonable manner. The midterm is open everything. You can use a laptop, book, notes, etc. The only restriction is that you cannot communicate with anyone. That being said, the biggest issue with the midterm is finishing it quickly. Metrics is all about apply the material that you learned so having all the resources is very useless if you can't actually utilize it. The final allows you to have 1 cheat sheet and is not open notes/laptop. The final does take the entire 3 hours. Again, take notes (he provides his lecture notes online as well), but definitely pay attention. Discussion sections are more like review and to cover anything you might've forgotten in your statistics class. There are also random pop quizzes that do matter (and help him count for attendance). Theres about 7/8 during the semester so go to class.",

There were problem sets on the syllabus but we never did any of them. There are 5 essays and participation is VERY CRUCIAL. You must \"apply\" to get into the class (ie. send Rasiel your resume and cover letter/letter of interest). She takes mostly all juniors with the exception of 1-3 sophomores. Highly recommended.

He is a PhD student at Duke, and I felt as if I was doing a majority of his research in this class. We did absolutely nothing related to what the course description said. He is a very dry lecturer and very unreasonable professor. For creative projects, he ends up expecting everyone to use the same fundamental tools and concepts (which is ridiculous). He is never clear about his expectations, and when he is, it's 1) too late and 2) way too unreasonable (the number of pages or deadline). We were supposed to learn how to use different digital tools such as Photoshop, After Effects, Google Sketchup, etc. but we barely covered the basics for all and any of these tools. He prides himself on not giving perfect grades and will take off a ridiculous amount of points for something very miniscule. This was an awful class that I learned absolutely nothing in and wasted way too much time. I can honestly say that everyone in my seminar class *hated* it and wrote awful course reviews; some students even petitioned their grades. Do NOT take a class with this professor.",

These problem sets are graded based on accuracy, so it is important to do them neatly and precisely.\n  Commentss: The class satisfies both my math requirements for my Econ and CompSci majors, which is a major bonus. The tests are difficult, and Professor Hahn moves through the course material very quickly, which can make the class challenging. I would recommend going to her office hours, because she is a lot more helpful one-on-one. Her lectures can be very dull, but she is a very funny woman which makes class fun sometimes.",

Read the book (very good resource and required) if you feel lost and go to office hours! He's a very fair and reasonable professor; he'll make alternate assignments to help boost your grades or will take into consideration your problem sets, class attendance, etc. That being said, the material is pretty abstract and can get complicated. Unless you have to take this class, I would suggest not doing so and taking an easier stat class. It is supposed to be very difficult and geared towards math majors. I found the topics very interesting though, and I would say that I learned a lot. The professor is also very witty, brilliant, and entertaining.",
